# Python Pentesting Practice
 Practicing development of my first pentesting tools using Python

HeaderGrab uses ```requests``` and ipinfo's API  to return an IP's HTTP ```GET``` response in JSON.

IPOverflow implemented in both Python and C, more explained here: https://ma.ttias.be/theres-more-than-one-way-to-write-an-ip-address/. I'm wondering if this logic can be used to bypass IP based firewall rules.......stay tuned 

NMap Scanner leverages NMAPs API to initate host discovery and print basic information

Work in Progress: Python Server and Client is a web server and client written in Python.

Sub Domain Discovery is a very simple take on subdomain discovery that utlizes a common subdomain list and bruteforces potential URL subdomains. This one is pretty basic and bare bones.

Hidden Wifi leverages ```scapy``` to capture request/response packets sent by hidden SSID's by looking for ```Dot11ProbeReq``` and  ```Dot11ProbeResp```. 

Mac Spoof spoofs MAC addresses on a supplied interface, in this case ```en0``` by passing in shell commands via ```subprocesss```

MD5 Crack utilizes ```hashlib``` to crack passwords by supplying it the hash, and a known passwords dictionary. Another barebones (and almost irrelevant) program. 

FlashFlood sends out a ```SYN``` flood to a specified IP, in this case, Google.com.
