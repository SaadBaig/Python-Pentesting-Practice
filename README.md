# Python Pentesting Practice
 Practicing development of my first pentesting tools using Python

**HeaderGrab** uses ```requests``` and ipinfo's API  to return an IP's HTTP ```GET``` response in JSON.

**IPOverflow** implemented in both Python and C, more explained here: https://ma.ttias.be/theres-more-than-one-way-to-write-an-ip-address/. I'm wondering if this logic can be used to bypass IP based firewall rules.......stay tuned 

**NMap Scanner** leverages NMAPs API to initate host discovery and print basic information

**Work in Progress: Python Server and Client** is a web server and client written in Python.

**Sub Domain Discovery** is a very simple take on subdomain discovery that utlizes a common subdomain list and bruteforces potential URL subdomains. This one is pretty basic and bare bones.

**Hidden Wifi** leverages ```scapy``` to capture request/response packets sent by hidden SSID's by looking for ```Dot11ProbeReq``` and  ```Dot11ProbeResp```. 

**MAC Spoof** spoofs MAC addresses on a supplied interface, in this case ```en0``` by passing in shell commands via ```subprocesss```

**MD5 Crack** utilizes ```hashlib``` to crack passwords by supplying it the hash, and a known passwords dictionary. Another barebones (and almost irrelevant) program. 

**FlashFlood** sends out a ```SYN``` flood to a specified IP, in this case, Google.com.

**Loud Detective** is an aptly named program that collects basic information about a URL (and in the future, IP address) including IP address, hostname and leverages ```nmap``` to do a simple port scan and output the status of each prodded port, as well as report on the status of the URL (host is up or down). I named this program Loud Detective because this program does not do the nmap port scan discretely. You can infer what the next version of this program will do (and will be called) ;) Expected output:
```
titanium@Saads-MBP Loud Detective % python ldetect.py yahoo.com
======Basic Information about: yahoo.com
IP Addresss: 98.138.219.231

Open Ports (and in the future, services) for: yahoo.com
('Scanning', 'yahoo.com', 'on ports 21, 22, 80, 137, 139, 443, 445, 8080, 8089')
('Port ', 21, 'is ', 'filtered')
('Port ', 22, 'is ', 'filtered')
('Port ', 23, 'is ', 'filtered')
('Port ', 80, 'is ', 'open')

('Port ', 443, 'is ', 'open')

('Port ', 8089, 'is ', 'filtered')
('Port ', 8080, 'is ', 'filtered')
('Host', 'yahoo.com', ' is ', 'up')
```

**ARP-ANET** is a less aptly named program. It was my first foray into using ```scapy```, a program used to create, forge and manipulate packets. I realized that in order to create the Quiet Detective program and fullfil its stealth scanning requirements, I needed a more powerful API to work with. Enter Scapy, a programmable way to initiate these scans (and do so much more). For ARP-ANET, a play on words, the goal was to enumerate all devices on a given IP address range by sending out an ```ARP``` request. Expected output (MAC addresses obfuscated, nice try ;):
```
Available devices in the network:
IP                  MAC
192.168.1.1         33:22:44:33:77:88
192.168.1.86        77:22:dd:66:ee:55
192.168.1.93        44:00:00:55:aa:66
192.168.1.111       88:00:33:ff:33:bb
192.168.1.151       55:66:99:ff:66:bb
192.168.1.193       00:00:55:55:55:44
192.168.1.226       bb:cc:aa:ff:dd:ff
```
